# Repo for holiday break project

We hope you have a good festive break and spend quality time with your family and friends! However, we also want you to keep your problem-solving and code-building skills in good working order so that we can hit the ground running in the new year. Instead of poring over notes, the best way to do this is to use your skills to build an application.

- Indulge your curiosity and creativity to fully ideate and plan before you build, making full use of the tools that we've introduced during the course.
- Use your computational thinking skills to break down each problem into its smallest parts.
- Build iteratively - once you have a working MVP, then you can go back and add additional features.
- Investigate online resources when you get stuck - this will be the best way to empower yourself to be able to tackle new tech and problems in your future careers. Read your error messages thoroughly, target your Google searches, and be systematic as you trace through your code for bugs.

## Requirements

- Ideation and planning
- Styled front end
- Fully RESTful API
- PostgreSQL database
- And more... Investigate and explore!
